# Integration.app Solution Engineer Test Assignment

## Task Overview

This repository contains a contact management app that lets users add, edit and delete contacts. It connects to other systems using the Integration.app SDK. The task is to add two-way contact syncing between this app and connected CRM systems, so that contacts stay up to date everywhere.


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Fill a `.env` file with your Integration.app workspace key and secret
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Implementation Requirements

- Implement integration with at least two CRM systems (e.g. HubSpot and Pipedrive - it's easy to get account there)
- Use the Integration.app React SDK

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll evaluate your solution based on:
1. **Integration Logic**
   - Clean and maintainable code structure
   - Proper error handling
   - Robust bi-directional sync logic
2. **Code Quality**
3. **User Experience**


## Submission Requirements

1. Source code repository
2. Live demo URL (e.g., Vercel deployment)
3. Brief documentation of your implementation approach and any assumptions or decisions made during development

## Questions and Support

Feel free to:
- Ask questions about the requirements
- Discuss implementation approaches
- Request clarification on any aspect
- Share your progress and get feedback

Remember, there's no single "correct" solution. We're interested in your approach, problem-solving skills, and ability to build a practical, working solution on your own.
